# Automotive-CAN-BUS-ID-list
Welcome to my Automotive GitHub repository! Here I will be uploading CAN BUS Dumps so everyone that needs it or wants to mess around can use the list.
I mainly did this because I used a CAN BUS Instrument Cluster for gaming and from there I bought a lot more instrument clusters to test things.
Enjoy!
